Introduction
-------------

Super Store Finder is a full featured PHP Application integrated with Google Maps that displays nearby stores based on client user location using Geo IP. The responsive user interface for both frontend and backend are using Bootstrap which are user friendly for any platform including mobile devices.

Administrators will have a secure area to create new and manage stores. The admin supports multiple admins where super admin can manage them.

----------

1. Database Setup

Run the SQL below to create the tables structure and sample data. A sample admin user is also created and all passwords are hashed using md5 encryption with salt is used. You can modify the salt which is located at '/admin/includes/config.inc.php' file.


/* Stores table */
CREATE TABLE `stores` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(255) character set utf8 collate utf8_bin NOT NULL,
  `address` varchar(255) character set utf8 collate utf8_bin NOT NULL,
  `telephone` varchar(25) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `fax` varchar(25) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `mobile` varchar(25) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `email` varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `website` varchar(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  `description` text character set utf8 collate utf8_bin NOT NULL,
  `approved` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  `latitude` float NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  `longitude` float NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  `created` datetime NOT NULL,
  `modified` datetime NOT NULL,
  `status` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '1',
  `cat_id` int(9) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);

/* Users table */
CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `username` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(100) NOT NULL, 
  `firstname` varchar(255) NOT NULL,

`cat_name` varchar(100) character set utf8 collate utf8_bin default NULL,
`cat_icon` varchar(255) default NULL,
`cat_parent_id` int(11) default NULL,
`cat_free_flag` int(1) default NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

/* insert admin user */
/* Username: admin, Password: password */
insert  into `users`(`username`,`password`) values ('admin','e64a4f78be2256a38de080744dd5b117');

2. Setting up the Frontend Database Info and Path
You must enter your database information at /includes/config.inc.php file. You also need to enter the directory of the frontend folder and the address of your frontend page. This will make calling other php, css and javascript files easier without having to change each file.

3. Setting up the Admin Database Info and Path

You must enter your database information at /admin/includes/config.inc.php file. You also need to enter the directory of the admin folder and the address of the admin panel. This will make calling other php, css and javascript files easier without having to change each file.


// Database Settings
define('HOSTNAME','localhost');
define('DB_USERNAME','database_username');
define('DB_PASSWORD','database_password');
define('DB_NAME','store_finder');

Finally, be sure to set permission to 777 for admin/imgs and admin/uploads directory recursively

4. Administrator's Area

To view to the Administrator's Area visit the '/admin' section. You will be required to login. The premade login is username: admin, password: password

You can have multiple admin users to manage your stores. Features such as Add/Edit/Delete admin users and change their password are available. To add a new admin user, login to administrator's area and click on 'Add Admin User' from the navigation bar. To view / edit / delete admin users, click on 'Admin User List'.

7. Adding Stores

To add a Store click the Add Store link from the main navigation. Here you can enter Store Name, Store Address, Upload picture, etc. Longitude and Latitude values will be auto detected upon entering an address.

10. Approving Stores

Stores that have added by users from frontend by default will be having status of 'Not Approved', this means that they must be approved by an admin user before it's visible at frontend. Administrators can approve a store add request by clicking the Approve link near the status column.

11.How to Disable Geo IP

If you wish to disable Geo IP, edit index.php and search for:

Edit it to your city and country, example:

$('#address').val("Sydney, Australia");
